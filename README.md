## Acknowledgement

- The [Humanizer](https://github.com/Humanizr/Humanizer) project on which the origin implementation is based. I hope to merge this project to Humanizer as soon as Esperanto exists as Culture in .NET.
- The [#esperanto](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=esperanto) IRC channel on freenode.
- Internet and the esperanto community for writing stuff about esperanto.
